The author gave up his life of crime and started hard work. His first debut album was in 2009, and after 10 years, he made this one. So, thanks for that music to the psychedelic future funk pirate that he is today.

Aria Math is a song full of Pan Drums and old synthesizers rhythmically dancing to ping pong delays. It’s also one of the Creative Mode songs. I wrote it with the beauty of the more extreme creations in Minecraft. Gigantic statues, entire cities, paintings, people, all recreated in this game. It’s awe-inspiring, and that’s what I wanted to kind of symbolize. Not sure if I succeeded? -- C418
